simple-wireless-tdma
====================

This is an ns3 (nsnam.org) module that originated with Hemanth Narra.
It has been updated to work under ns3 3.24.1.

## Example
I have been able to run the tdma-example.cc by placing it under the 
scratch directory so that 

./waf --run tdma-example

will run. A configuration setting is missing somewhere to allow it to
run from the src/simple-wireless-tdma/example directory.
